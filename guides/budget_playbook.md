#Regional desk budget playbook##Questions to ask about any budget*	**What’s the big picture?** Is funding up or down since last year, the recession, the year 2000? Is revenue up? Will there be a deficit?
*	**What are the takeaways?** A budget is a statement of priorities. What are they?*	**Who can tell you what you want to know?** Find budget watchdogs in and out of government. Budget analysts, controllers and advocacy groups can all inform your budget stories.*	**What are the specifics?** What timely or bizarre projects were funded this year? How can one line item give insight into the larger budgeting process? What can you follow up on in six months?*	**How much do neighboring munis spend on the same thing?** Asking this can give you a good sense of priorities. To get per capita spending, divide the amount of money by the number of people who live in the jurisdiction.	* [Censusreporter.org](http://censusreporter.org) is an easy place to look up population and other demographic info*	**Have neighbors done the same thing?** Has the headline-grabbing new program been tried elsewhere in SoCal? Is it an expansion of an existing effort? Those could give clues to how it’ll fare.*	**How have things changed?** It’s always good to check how funding has changed over time. But don’t forget inflation.	* For example: $1 million in 2000 dollars is worth $1.4 million today. So if a department’s budget has increased by 40% in the last 15 years, it hasn’t really increased at all.	* The Bureau of Labor Statistics [has a nifty calculator for figuring these things out](http://1.usa.gov/1SAZRhC). Bookmark it. *	**What does the audited financial statement say?** The auditors can bury the good stuff in the footnotes. Things to look for: are there adjustments from last year or pending litigation? Look also for budget memos for clues. LA’s City Administrator released 100 budget memos in May 2015.*	**What’s missing?** Agencies don’t always get what they want. Some budget docs (like LA County’s) will tell you what’s been left out, in an “unmet needs” section for each department. *	**What do I do with the budget the rest of the year?** Print it out and keep it on your desk (or desktop). Use it!
